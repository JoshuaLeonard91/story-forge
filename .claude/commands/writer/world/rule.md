**2. Description:** Detailed explanation of how this rule works

**3. Scope:**
1. Universal - Applies everywhere in your world
2. Regional - Only applies in certain locations
3. Situational - Applies in specific circumstances

## Optional Details (recommended)

After you provide these details, I will:
1. Call `mcp__story-db__addWorldRule` to save the rule to your project database
2. Display the rule ID and summary
3. The rule will be used by the context retrieval system when writing scenes

**Examples of World Rules:**
- "Magic requires line of sight to target"
- "Teleportation is impossible due to quantum anchoring"
- "Social hierarchy: Nobles → Merchants → Commoners → Serfs"
- "Dragons cannot lie but can mislead"

Please provide the world rule details above.
